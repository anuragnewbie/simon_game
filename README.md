This is a simon game project.

I have developed this game using html5, css, bootstrap4 and jquery.

I have developed this game during taking web development class at Udemy.

Thanx to Angela Yu ma'am.

It's such a game where there will be a master called as Simon and whatever
command he will give the other three members will need to follow. The three
members need to remeber the sequence of the game pattern.

Hope you will like it and if you want to modify it or debug my code pls
feel free to do that.

Thank you. ðŸ˜€
